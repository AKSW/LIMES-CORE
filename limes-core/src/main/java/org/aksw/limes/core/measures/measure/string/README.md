# String measures

In this directory you can find various string measures.

To run the corresponding tests, you should have the following required resources in the
`limes-core/src/test/resources` directory of the LIMES project.

 - en-de-small.txt (a tab-separated English-to-German dictionary with ~200000 entries. You should create one yourself or find it online.)
 - unsup128.en & unsup128.de (https://nlp.stanford.edu/~lmthang/bivec/)
 - WordNet-3.0 (unzip the following file and put the resulting directory in the same directory as the other resources here: http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WordNet-3.0.tar.gz)
 - en-freq.txt / de-freq.txt (word frequency files for English and German. About 100k entries would be best. You can get those files here: https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/tree/master/content/2016")
